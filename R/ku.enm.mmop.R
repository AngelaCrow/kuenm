#' Extrapolation risk analysis for multiple comparisons
#'
#' @description ku.enm.mmop calculates mobility-oriented parity (MOP) layers by
#' comparing environmental values between the calibration area and multiple areas or
#' scenarios to which ecological niche models are transferred.
#'
#' @param dirG a raster stack of variables representing the calibration area.
#' @param dirM a raster stack of variables representing the full area, areas or scenarios to
#' which models are transferred.
#' @param sets.var (character) value or vector with the name(s) of the sets of variables
#' from dirG and dirM that are going to be compared to create the MOP(s).
#' @param out.mop (character) name of the folder to which MOP results will be written.
#' @param percent (numeric) percetage of values sampled from the calibration region to calculate the MOP.
#' @param normalized (logical) if TRUE, values of similarity are presented scaled linearly from 0 to 1,
#' default = TRUE.
#'
#' @return A folder containing one or multiple mobility-oriented parity raster layers depending on
#' how many projection areas or scenarios are considered. This results will be organized by the
#' different sets of variables chosen for creating final models.
#'
#' @details This function can be used after selection of parameters that produce the best
#' models (when chosen sets of variables are known), or after producing final models
#' with the function \code{\link{ku.enm.mod}}. In a MOP layer, areas of strict extrapolation
#' are excluded and other values represent how similar areas or scenarios are to
#' environmental conditions in the calibration area. MOP is calculated following Owens et al.
#' (2013; \url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.04.011}).
