\title{Creation of Maxent models with selected parameters}
\usage{
ku.enm.mod(occ.joint, M.var.dir, out.eval, batch, rep.n = 10,
  rep.type = "Bootstrap", jackknife = FALSE, out.dir,
  out.format = "logistic", project = FALSE, G.var.dir, ext.type = "all",
  write.mess = FALSE, write.clamp = FALSE, run = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{occ.joint}{(character) is the  csv file with all the occurrences, columns must be: species, longitud, latitud.}

\item{M.var.dir}{(character) name of the forlder containing folders in wich calibration (M) variables are.}

\item{out.eval}{(character) name of the folder were evaluation results were written.}

\item{batch}{(character) name of the batch file with the code to create all final Maxent models.}

\item{rep.n}{(numeric) number of model replicates.}

\item{rep.type}{(character) is the replicate type, it can be: "Crossvalidate", "Bootstrap", or "Subsample".}

\item{jackknife}{(logical) if true, a jackknife process will be performed while runing Maxent models, default = FALSE.}

\item{out.dir}{(character) name of the output directory to be created and in which all models subdirectories
will be created.}

\item{out.format}{(character) is the models output format, it can be: "raw", "logistic", "cloglog", or "cumulative".}

\item{project}{(logical) if true your models will be projected to the scenarios in G.var.dir, default = FALSE.}

\item{G.var.dir}{(character) if project is true, name of the forlder containing folders in wich variables of your
projection scenarios are.}

\item{ext.type}{(character) if project is true, is the extrapolation type of projections, can be: "all", "ext_clam",
"ext", and "no_ext", default = "all". ext = free extrapolation, ext_clam = extrapolation and clamping,
no_ext = no extrapolation, and all = all, the three previous options.}

\item{write.mess}{(logical) if true, grids of MESS analysis results will be written, default = FALSE.}

\item{write.clamp}{(logical) if true, a grid of the spatial distribution of clamping will be written, default = FALSE.}

\item{run}{(logical) if true the batch runs after its creation, if false it will only be created and its runnig
would be manual, default = TRUE.}
}
\value{
A folder named as out.dir with all the subfolders to save maxent final model's results when running the .bat file.
A batch file for creating all the final maxent models with their projections if project = TRUE.
}
\description{
ku.enm.mod creates and executes a batch file for generating Maxent models using the
parameters previously selected with the \code{\link{ku.enm.eval}} function.
}
\details{
Same requirements than in \code{\link{ku.enm.cal}}
